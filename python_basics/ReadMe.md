# 🐍 Python Basics – Level 1

This repository contains my journey through the **Level 1 of Python**, where I practiced and implemented the core concepts of the language with hands-on mini projects and a final major project.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

During this level, I covered all fundamental Python topics including:

- ✅ `print()` – Displaying output
- ✅ `input()` / Output – Taking user input
- ✅ Variables – Storing data
- ✅ Data Types – `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- ✅ Operators – Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical
- ✅ Conditional Statements – `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested `if`
- ✅ Loops – `for`, `while`
- ✅ Built-in Functions – `range()`
- ✅ Loop Controls – `break`, `continue`, `pass`

## 💡 Mini Projects

To strengthen the concepts, I created several mini-projects using only the Level 1 tools:

1. **🎲 Number Guessing Game**  
   - Guess a randomly generated number  
   - Feedback: Too high / Too low  
   - Attempt counter

2. **🧮 Simple Calculator**  
   - User input-based calculator  
   - Supports +, -, *, /

3. **🔢 Odd-Even Checker with Counter**  
   - Checks even/odd numbers in a given range  
   - Displays total count of each

4. **🗳️ Voting Eligibility System**  
   - Age + nationality based eligibility checker  
   - Uses nested `if` logic

5. **🔐 Login Authentication**  
   - Simple login system  
   - Username/password check with limited attempts

## 🧩 Major Project – Python Utility App

As a final integration task, I combined all mini-projects into one **menu-driven CLI interface**, simulating a multi-tool console app.

### 🛠 Features:
- Main menu to choose any of the above features
- Interactive and easy-to-use terminal experience
- Uses loops, conditionals, input/output and logic from Level 1

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Core logic building using Python
- Writing clean, readable code
- Thinking in terms of inputs, flow, and conditions
- Making CLI programs user-friendly

## 🚀 Next Steps

I'll be moving on to:
> 🔓 **Level 2: Functions, Lists, Tuples, and String Manipulation**

---

## 📌 Note

This repository contains:
- Python source code for each mini project
- Final combined major project script
- Clear comments and clean structure for readability
