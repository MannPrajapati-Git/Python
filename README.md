## 📘 What This Repository Offers

This repository contains multiple **structured folders** covering the **entire journey of Python**, each with:
- 📂 Source code examples
- 📄 Notes and explanations
- 💡 Mini-projects and challenges
- ✅ Hands-on practice for each level

You’ll learn everything from writing your first “Hello, World” program to building class-based systems using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

- Hello World, Input/Output
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)
- If-Else, Nested If
- Loops (for, while)
- `range()`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`

### ✅ LEVEL 2: Data Structures in Python  
**Goal**: Handle data effectively with built-in collections  
- Strings (Indexing, Slicing, Built-in functions)
- Lists (Append, Insert, Pop, Sort)
- Tuples (Immutable Lists)
- Sets (Unique items, Set operations)
- Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)
- List Comprehensions

### ✅ LEVEL 3: Functions, Recursion & Modules  
**Goal**: Write reusable and clean code  
- Functions (`def`, `return`, parameters)
- Default and Keyword Arguments
- Recursion
- Lambda Functions
- `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Modules (`import`, `math`, `random`, etc.)

---

### ✅ LEVEL 4: File Handling & Exception Handling  
**Goal**: Read/write files and handle runtime errors  
- File Operations (`open`, `read`, `write`, `append`, modes)
- `with open` context manager
- Try/Except/Finally Blocks
- Custom Exceptions

---

### ✅ LEVEL 5: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)  
**Goal**: Understand class-based structure like in real apps  
- Classes & Objects
- `__init__()` Constructor
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, etc.)
