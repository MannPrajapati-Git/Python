# 🐍 Python Learning Journey – Level 5 Part-2 Complete!

## ✅ LEVEL 5 Part-2: Exception Handling in Python  
**Goal:** Write error-proof, robust programs using exception handling techniques.

---

# 📚 Topics Covered:
## In this repository, you’ve mastered both **basic and advanced** Python exception handling:

- ✅ What is an Exception vs Error?
- ✅ `try` / `except` blocks
- ✅ Catching Specific Exceptions (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple `except` blocks
- ✅ Grouping multiple exceptions in a single `except`
- ✅ Using `as e` to print error details
- ✅ `else` block after try-except
- ✅ `finally` block for guaranteed execution
- ✅ Nested `try-except` blocks
- ✅ Using `raise` to manually trigger errors
- ✅ Using `assert` for debugging and validations
- ✅ Creating and using **custom exception classes**
- ✅ Real-world examples of user input and data validation

# 💡 Highlights:

| Feature              | Purpose                                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `try/except`         | Handle runtime errors gracefully                           |
| `else`               | Run only if no exception occurred                          |
| `finally`            | Always execute cleanup code (like file closing)            |
| `raise`              | Manually throw an error if a condition fails               |
| `assert`             | Debug conditionally with built-in checks                   |
| Custom Exceptions    | Build specific, meaningful error messages for your logic   |

## 🧪 Real-world Examples Implemented:
- Validating user age inputs
- Division and type conversion with full error protection
- File existence and reading with fallback handling
- Custom error messages like `InvalidAgeError`

## 📌 Keep Building!
Error handling is what separates hobby scripts from **real-world applications**. You’ve just unlocked the shield that protects your code!

Happy coding! 🚀✨
