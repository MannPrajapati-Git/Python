\chapter{Basics}
This book is typeset in two columns. The origin of \LaTeX{} can be traced back to the development of \TeX{} by Donald Knuth in 1977. 

Frustrated by the poor quality of the typesetting in his books, Knuth designed \TeX{} as a way to ensure high-quality output for technical documents. \TeX{} provides precise control over formatting but has a steep learning curve, especially for users unfamiliar with programming.
