   abstract = {<p>Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a severe public health threat due to their rapid progression into critical conditions like sepsis. This study presents a novel eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to predict BSIs using historical electronic health records (EHRs). Leveraging a dataset from St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim, Norway, encompassing 35,591 patients, the framework integrates demographic, laboratory, and comprehensive medical history data to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk BSI groups. By avoiding reliance on real-time clinical data, our model allows for enhanced scalability across various healthcare settings, including resource-limited environments. The XAI framework significantly outperformed traditional models, particularly with tree-based algorithms, demonstrating superior specificity and sensitivity in BSI prediction. This approach promises to optimize resource allocation and potentially reduce healthcare costs while providing interpretability for clinical decision-making, making it a valuable tool in hospital systems for early intervention and improved patient outcomes.</p>},
